- 👋 Hi, I’m @MVinoly
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all aspects of full stack development and programming in general, and of course working in those fields.
- 🌱 I have just recently graduated from Robertson College Full Stack Developer Course with honours and while searching for work, I have been trying to expand my knowledge 
- to other topics that weren't necessarily touched on in school (React-Native etc.)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really, I am always looking to learn new things and won't stop working at them until I get things right
- 📫 Best wway to reach me is by email at michaelvinoly78@gmail.com
